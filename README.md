# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
> A simple Sorting Algorithm Visualizer using a GTK gui in C++.

## External Libraries Used

`gtkmm 2.0`\
I personally downloaded this by running the command:
```
apt-get install libgtkmm-2.0-dev
```

## Notes on Usage

As I am using GTK this project is only available on Linux. However, my [portfolio](https://aaronthenerd.github.io/Portfolio) will include videos of the sort running.

## Compilation and Execution

Running `make run` or `make run_debug` in the project directory will automatically compile and execute the project. 

## Future Work

I would like to add more customization and control without modifiying the source code. However, as I am not comfortable with front-end programming this may take a long time. A few ideas are a stop and play button, a slider to control the speed of the animation, options for the background color, the bar colors, and the colors for the swapping and comparisons. Additionally, I would like to add sounds to the swapping of the bars. Although I'd need to do more research on libraries for playing sounds before I could do that.
